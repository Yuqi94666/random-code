        "description": "&lt;p&gt;An eSIM, as opposed to a physical SIM, is a SIM that's already embedded into selected mobile phones and tablets, so you don't need a physical SIM to use your plan. It allows you to have up to five different plans on the same device and you can switch between them as you wish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your device has dual-SIM capability, you can use two plans at the same time by having one plan on your physical SIM and the other on your eSIM. For example, you'll be able to use one plan for business and another plan for personal use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activating an eSIM is now also faster and simpler, as you no longer need to scan a QR code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more on how to manage your eSIM, check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vodafone.com.au/support/device/esim&quot;&gt;support page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"
